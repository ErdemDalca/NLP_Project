## **Leapfrog**

*Game Design Document*

### Version 1.0

October 11, 2024

1. **Introduction**
   We are making/developing a new innovative version of Leapfrog. It is a parkour game where you play as a small frog and try to make it through a series of obsticles to the finish line and on to the next level. The player will only be able to leap or hop around through the environment. 
   2.**Prototype Objective**
   *Questions* : 
   
   1. Can the player make it to the goal with limited movement?  
   2. How does being small affect your ability to navigate the environment? 
      We would like to test whether players enjoy overcoming the challenge of restricted movement while playing from the perspecive of a small frog.

2. **Leaping like a Frog**   
   The player will be limited in movement as they can only hop around. 

3. **Borrowers Perspective**     
   Player controls a character which is much smaller than the environment ( frog, grasshopper, tiny person ). 

4. **Hazards**     
   The environment may contain hazards which will reset the player upon collision ( water, spikes, lava, fall damage )

5. **Player Controls**     
   The player will use ( W,A,S,D ) to control airborne direction, ( Mouse ) to look around and ( Spacebar ) to leap.

6. **Objective Statement**  
   We aim to test whether players enjoy overcoming the challenge of restricted movement while playing from the perspecive of a small frog.

7. **Design Rationale**
   The game aims to be uniquely challenging and engaging with lots of potential replay ablility. It is an innovative game, putting a fresh twist on the traditional parkour games by limiting player movement while also trying to navigate a large and potentialy hostle environment.

# Barriers
## Game Design Document

### Intended For:
People who like both puzzles and linguistics. And are willing to think and be frustrated for a while.

### Plot:
You meet a stranger that speaks a very foreign language. You need something from him, and he seems to need something from you. His language only contains like 20 words, none of which you understand. (Each word should be a single letter, I think. Which means, at max, 26 total words) You must learn his language in order to find out what he wants, tell him what you want, and get each other what you guys need. There is no secret trick to learning his language. Literally just talk to him and be confused. Try different sentence combinations until something seems to make sense. You would start with the knowledge of which words are nouns, verbs, or other from your basic language classes at explorer school. And there would be a button to show him things that you are holding.


### Basics:
You can walk around, pick things up, move them around, show them to the stranger, and then other things that are probably level-specific that interact with the objects on the screen.

You can also talk to the stranger, which is the core of the game. You can say whatever combination of words to him in his language, and he will respond in a way that makes sense. You can't use tone of voice or gestures or anything like that because it would be impossible to code. The lore reason can be that the stranger has face blindness, and gestures are totally differnet in his culture.

### Design:
Very basic, like an 8-bit, kind of. --> ![](https://github.com/sozalpasan1/The-Alien/blob/main/image1.png)

Halfway in between Stardew Valley and Baba Is You (both have pictures attached)

It’s a 2D game, and we have a Birds Eye view of you walking around. The floor is hexagons. The graphics are bad, and the user can just be a circle or something.

### Other Stuff:
We will hopefully make multiple levels. The language, along with what each of you need from each other, is completely different every time. But the mechanics and the goal are the same.

But different levels aren’t necessarily harder or easier. Keep in mind that I want to keep this realistic, so it’s totally OK if the game is “too hard”. We can make it easier afterward, as long as we always stick to the fact that the alien is actually speaking in his language. It can be a very simple language (like I said, only like 20 words), but the rules must be consistent. 



### WORDS USED IN EVERY LEVEL:
I, You, No, Yes, One, Two, Many, question, want, be (just one word for am, is, was, are, etc), give, take


### WORDS SPECIFIC TO LEVEL 1:
Wolf, Help, Lock, Key, Rock, food


### PLOT FOR LEVEL 1:
You are on the other side of a fence from the stranger. You can’t climb over (being able to physically interact with the stranger would add too many new variables. Maybe for level 2 you’re like, watching the alien through cameras and can speak back and forth through the intercom and stuff?). Anyway, you need him to give you some of the food that is lying around on his side of the fence because you are very hungry. He needs you to look under a rock on your side of the fence to get a key, and then throw the key to him so he can unlock his chains and leave. There are wolves in the area and he wants to get out of there before they find him.



### NOTE:
The plot may change if it needs to. What’s important is simplicity and consistency.

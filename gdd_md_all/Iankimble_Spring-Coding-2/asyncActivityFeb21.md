## 2. On your document answer the following questions about your upcoming game project

As we embark on our game development journey, I would like you to begin brainstorming what kind of game you want to build by creating a draft of a game design document.
Your game can be a custom and unique project or it can be clone of an already existing game. 

1. What is the name of your game?

2. What genre is your game going to be in (horror, action-adventure, shooting, fighting, platformer, etc.)

3. What is the objective and general game loop of your game? Please write your response in complete sentences.
example: players will try to score points by hitting randomized targets in a set amount of time. 

4. What already existing games does your game take inspiration from? Please provide at least 3 examples, including the name of the game, and describe the aspect your inspired by in complete sentences.

5. Please describe the mechanics, or functional parts that will be in your game
example: 
- a. my game will allow the player to move across the screen horizontally
- b. my game will feature  different weapon types that will have different effects.

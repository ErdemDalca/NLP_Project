## Overview
ADHD is a medical condition that affects attention, self-control, and the ability to sit still. The **Feelings Thermometer** is a visual tool that helps children recognize their emotions and suggests calming activities like counting to 10, taking deep breaths, or dancing.

### Target Audience
- **Age Range:** Children from 6 to 12 years old.
- **Platform:** Android, specifically for the **Samsung Galaxy A71**. The prototype can also be tested using a computer webcam if required due to technical limitations.

## Concept
Using AR, the app allows children to:
- Select an emotion they are currently feeling.
- View a list of feeling names.
- Engage in recommended healthy behaviors, such as taking a walk or relaxing.

## Project Scope
- **Development Period:** November 22 to December 12, 2023.
- The prototype supports an **MVP** iteration for future enhancements.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Unity Editor**
- **AR Foundation** for AR features.
- **Vuforia** for image tracking and AR integration.
- **Text Mesh Pro** for UI text and interaction.
- **Free 3D Thermometer Model**
- **Audio Components** for mood stabilization prompts.

## Functionalities
- **AR Session:** Initiates the AR environment.
- **Multi-Target Image Tracking:** Recognizes and interacts with selected emotion images.
- **UI Canvas & 3D Models:** Displays interactive feelings and activities.
- **Offline Functionality:** Ensures the app can work offline once deployed on the Android device.

## User Workflow
1. Children select how they are feeling through images in AR.
2. The app suggests calming activities like counting to 10 or listening to calming music.
3. Visual and auditory components guide the child through mood stabilization.

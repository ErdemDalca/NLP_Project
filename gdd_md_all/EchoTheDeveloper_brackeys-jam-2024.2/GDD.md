## Ideas

* Surfing then there was a storm now you must make it back home (top down preferably) -I_EatCode
* ***2D Top-Down* You are staying in a small town, for (possibly an interview or seeing family), that is preparing for a huge storm , you find out secrets about this town and the residents *SELECTED***

## Must need

## Story

### Idea 1 - The Cult and The Rich Man

The player is at the village, where he lives. But a massive storm is approaching. Everyone evactuating the village but you are trapped outside. When you wake up, you find out there is a cult who worships the storm, and are waiting for it. However as it progresses and you have to disguise as one of the cult members, You discover that the cult leader is actually a millionare who is doing this to keep his people in line, and the storm is made by him. There are multiple endings:
* You stop the storm, by destroying his machine/thing that is making the storm and he gets arrested
* You survive, but do not stop the storm, and the village is destroyed. The millionare and cult are killed by the storm (canon ending)\
* The storm reaches before you have any defense and you die aswell

- Gameplay
  - exploration
  - stealth
  - dialogue
  - multiple endings


### Idea 2 - Truth Behind The Storm

The player moves to the village for work but the company never existed. The next train back is the next week. Then the storm is annouced to be coming directly to the village. The storm is actually 2 gods fighting cause magnitude 9 earthquakes, tornados, and tsunamis. The player figures this out from notes in an abandoned office. You have to build deffences. But in the end you have to stop the gods from fighting. It is revealed at the end that a 3rd god is the one who gave you the job that never existed. The end. Also god 1 was angry at god 2 because god 2 stole god 1's crisps (chips for americans) Multiple endings. For example not building any defences and dying, deciding not to break up the god fight, and the cannon ending beating. I like this but sinec we have 1 week what if we add 1 ending or maybe 2 and we can continue after (if we go with this)(sure whoever put thi) ECHO DID aidaoidhjosi

- Gameplay
  - resource gathering
  - defence building

### Idea 3 - The Truth of Cedarveil:
- Setting: a small town preparing for a large storm, the town's calm appearance hides dark secrets
- Plot: 
  - Introduction: You arrive in town for a casual visit to see your family. Something you have done plenty of times. However something is different this time.
    - Initial Calm: The small town is very peaceful and you are very unsuspecting as to what you will uncover
  - Discovery: The player checks out multiple locations where the storm will go through and finds numerous haunting findings related to the village. Some pointing towards that the residents are not who they look like, including his family... (did i cook?) 
- Conflict: 
  - Keeping his disguise: He then has to make it seem like he doesn't know any of the haunting stuff and try's to stay calm however the more he reveals the truth, the close the storm gets, 
  - Storm creeping closer as he finds out more
- Climax: as the storm gets closer, you and the normal residents reveal the hidden truths behind the Storm. This shows your family you are visitng is not your actual family and are actually some kind of inhabitant or smth like that 
- Resolution
  - Successful: you manage to reveal the truth while also preparing for the storm
  - Disaster: You fail to stay calm under the pressure of knowing what is happening behind the scenes and the towns secret may live another day...
  - Double Meaning: The storm causes confusion and amnesia, making your player forget everything he learned about the town, leaving him to leave a few days later back home not knowing that his family is in danger
- Gameplay:
  - Dialogue /w choices
  - Stealth
  - Investigation/exploration
  - 3 endings (2 before for game jam)
  - Heart rate (your heartrate gets to high when you start making weird choices which leads to people asking if you are ok and can raise suspsion)
  - dynamic storm

# Wick's End

~~A coop partie game to reach the end of a procedural dungeon.~~

You are a little candle, alone in the darkness of a mysterious dungeon. You must keep the light on but also enough wax in order to survive. Your goal is to lit all the lamp of the level in order access the next one.

More information in `/gdd/game design document.md`.

## Roadmap

### Part 1 : technical demonstration

- [x] create a repository.
- [x] create a [Game Design Document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document).
- [ ] create a basic game with *programer art* (probably gonna hurt the eyes but it will be useful for debugging)

### Part 2 : bare bone game

- [ ] add basic mechanic and enemies
- [ ] add object interaction (or stuff like that)
- [ ] implement game mechanics (dice, procedural map, save)

### Part 3 : tests with friends

- [ ] create a true server that run 24/7 that host a score table
- [ ] add a score checker to prevent cheat and hack (replay the full game from log file)

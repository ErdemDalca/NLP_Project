Current Personal Project. A Tableau-Building Card Game based on the themes of exploring, terraforming, and settling
planets.

# Motivation

For Terra is a personal project where I explore the design of tabletop games.
In particular, I am exploring the design of Card Draw.

# Approach

It'd be a waste to leave my computer science background behind,
so I'm using digital tools to aid the process. However, as an extra challenge,
I am learning and making this game using the

# About

Factions cooperate to terraform and colonize planets for Terra, humanity's home planet, while competing for fame. With
each successive competition, players accumulate resources that can unlock higher-tier research and abilities, which
enable them to take on greater challenges.

Mechanically, it is a tableau-building board game inspired by Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition. Progression-wise, it
is based on Legacy and Campaign games, such as Pandemic Legacy, Gloomhaven, and Arkham Horror the Card Game.

# Design Space of Card Draw
Draw Power
Each time a player draws from a card deck, the cost of draw power required from that card deck increases by 1.
E.G., If a player has 3 draw power, the player can draw 1 time from Biotech, AI, and Space deck each. Alternatively, the player can draw 2 times from biotech (1+2=3).

# Minimum Viable Game
## Really the minimum
The minimum experience of this videogame would be: an area where the user is able to take ingredients, put them in a pot, take away the elixir, and giving it to the customers.

## Tutorial
The most important thing is for people to be able to play the game and understand the mechanics. Since VR can be specially challenging by itself, the tutorial shoul dbe a smooth experience on playing the game and should introduce the player to the different mechanics at a good peace. For that, we have established that for our Project Hand in, the focus would be on the tutorial experience.

# UI
## Customers
How they show what they want.

## Pot
How to know which ingredients are in.

## INgredients
How to know when they should be refilled.

# Game mechanics
## Putting ingredients into a pot
The order in which the ingredients are put does not matter for the final outcome.

## Taking out the potion
The user needs to be the one that says when the potion is done, hence, there needs to be an extra action for it. They will need to grab one of the empty available flasks and grab the potion with it, then the inside will be transfered to the flask and they will be able to chosoe which client it goes to.

## Refilling ingredients
** TBD **

## Tutorial story
### Outside of the shop
The user will start by being outside of the shop, where they will have the option to look around, and then they will need to interact with the "closed" sign to enter the place. This will let them understand the concept of interacting with objects and which triggers they need to use.

After turning the sign to open, they will enter the store, the controllers will be disabled and they will be automatically taken through the store and travelled into the working station. There is some monologue/story.

Inside, they will be asked to look for an ingredient and grab it.

 ** TBD ** 
Then they will need to give the potion to a customer. Here thet learn how to grab objects from a distance.

# Game components
## Ingredients
### Having 3 ingredients
With 3 ingredients we would have 7 possible combinations where all of the ingredients are used, and there are no null or all different ingredients at the same time option. Because of the reduced combinations, having only 3 ingredients has been discarded.

### Having 4 ingredients
** TBD **

## Recipes
** TBD **

## Audio
Audio will be looked to be the main thing in the tutorial experience, with subtitles as secondary (though implemented well for accessibility).

# Takeaways from trying out the design
## Interactions
- Needing to grab something twice when you need to put it twice is annoying

## UI
UI will be super important to make sure the suer knows what is going on.

# To think about
## Interactions
- ~~Putting a potion in a flask.~~
- Sending the potion to a specific client.
- Are all ingredients equally easy to get?

## Making potions
- Having "boost"petition that give you less time to complete and give bonus points?
- What happens if you make a potion that nobody asked for? Can you store some?
- What happens if you hand a wrong option?
- Can you put more than 4 ingredients?
- How do you show which ingredients are in already?
- ~~How do you take the potion out?~~
- If the potion does not exist (it is wrong) what happens? Does it destroy itself? How does it show you you need to throw it away?
- How does it let you know the current state?
- Does it tell you the name of the recipe when you take it out? Like when you cook in breath of the wild.

## Scoring points
- Is the level a level? Endless? By points?
- How do you make points? Is it by ingredient? By amount of ingredients? Is there a streak?

## Clients interactions
- How long does a client stay?
- How do they enter the scene?
- How do they leave?

## Future possible challenges
- Need to wait for stuff to refill
- Glasses need to be cleaned

A cool way of implementing anotehr interaction that is made possible by using VR is stirring. The elixir that the customers are asking for will have a sign on how the stirring should go. The user can choose to complete the potion without stirring. But, if the user does decide to stirr and they do it correctly, then they will be rewarded. If they do not do the stirring correctly, thenm they will be punished. And if they do not stir at all, nothing out of the ordinary will happen.

Whenever the user grabs the stirring object, the view will be locked on the pot and the stirring interaction will start.

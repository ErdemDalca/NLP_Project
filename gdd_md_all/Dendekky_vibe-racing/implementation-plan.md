## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Three.js performance issues.
  - **Mitigation**: Create configurable asset optimization settings, optimize rendering differently for various hardware.
- **Risk**: Socket.IO latency with 8 players.
  - **Mitigation**: Use namespaces, reduce payload size, test with simulated lag.
- **Risk**: Scope creep (e.g., extra features).
  - **Mitigation**: Stick to GDD; defer extras to post-launch.
- **Risk**: Network disconnections during gameplay.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling with user notifications and automatic recovery where possible.

---

## Additional Considerations
- **Platform Focus**: Desktop browsers first, with mobile optimization considered for future updates.
- **Security**: Security considerations to be reviewed in detail later in development.
- **Bot AI**: Implement human-like behavior with difficulty levels varying by track (more aggressive/difficult on some terrains).
- **Player Experience**: Room creator should have the ability to quit and restart during gameplay, with auto-termination if creator is unavailable.

## Next Steps
1. Assign tasks to team members based on roles.
2. Kick off Phase 1 with a team sync.
3. Schedule weekly check-ins to track progress.
4. Maintain progress.md with development status, bugs, features, and roadblocks.

This plan ensures a structured, detailed approach to building the game. Adjust timelines or tasks as needed based on team size and expertise.

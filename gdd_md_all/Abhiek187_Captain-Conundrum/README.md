## About

This is my first publicly released iOS game, created at Make School Summer Academy 2017. It's a top-down space shooter with two objectives. One is to destroy as many obstacles as you can to get a high score. The other is to avoid as many obstacles as you can to get a low score. As time progresses, enemies get faster and power-ups will come along the way. Use these to your advantage in order to destroy or avoid obstacles. Tilt the phone to control the spaceship and tap to shoot a laser beam. The game ends if your ship takes too much damage.

Captain Conundrum features leaderboards and achievements, which can be accessed through the Game Center, as well as many different options. You can change the control style, adjust the sensitivity of the gyro controls, and customize your spaceship.

## Install

As of July 2019, the game is no longer available on the iOS store, but can still be locally downloaded. A Mac is required with Xcode installed. Clone this repo and open the project up on Xcode. Then run your program. It is recommended that you run this on a real iPhone since there's no gyroscope on the simulator. However, the game can still be played on a virtual device if the joystick option is enabled. (Hold the option key while moving the joystick to move and shoot.)

## Wiki

This game was created in only 8 weeks, and it was a blast (no pun intended) to build this game from the ground up. To learn more about the journey and to see an in-depth look into the game and all the features I was planning to implement, [check out this Game Design Document in the Wiki](https://github.com/Abhiek187/Captain-Conundrum/wiki/Game-Design-Document).

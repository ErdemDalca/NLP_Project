So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Continue discussing planning strategies

## Finding it difficult to identify tasks?
_Finding it difficult to know what you need to do?_ You may find it beneficial to create a design macro to identify all of the critical things you imagine needing in your project.


## Guiding development with a design macro
A design macro represents an overview of your project's design, listing all important aspects in a compact way. It typically consists of two parts- a design overview and a design macro chart. We'll focus on the latter this week.

### For example...
In commercial game development settings, this approach has replaced the once common monolithic game design document as key to game design planning. Macros are developed at the end of the pre-production phase of a game's development, and once completed, macros are typically _set in stone_ with very little deviation during the game's development.

### Macro not Micro
The design macro isn't concerned with describing small details, instead providing just enough detail to steer development in a clear and compact way. Once finished, it serves as a map for your development, able to provide all important quantitative aspects of your project at a glance.

This approach makes the design macro not only effective at communicating our  design ideas, but it also makes it an instrumental tool in scheduling development. 

### Design macro chart
The design macro chart is simply a spreadsheet or table which provides a step-by-step breakdown of a project. It includes information on a project's content, actions, narrative progression, and emotional beats. 

[Here's a nice template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHgzKnf3q6_eWLwdr2nA7_0GeJer2VZG9YJxq2f7IW4/edit?usp=sharing) by Richard Lemarchand, an educator at USC and former game designer at Naughty Dog. Lemarchand has a great overview of this process in his book, A Playful Production Process (which is also an excellent introduction to the structure and processes of commercial game development!)

#### Macro chart organization
The organization of the chart is relatively straightforward:
- Rows: The vertical axis of the chart represents time and is organized sequentially (except when a project has a nonlinear structure). This includes _all_ parts of the project, from start to finish, including title screens, bumpers, menus, and credits.
- Columns: The horizontal axis lists important information relevant to the design of each part of the project. _Note: the ones provided in the template are probably good for most things in this class, but if your project does not require a column listed, delete it or substitute it with something more relevant._

#### Rows
Using this simple structure, _each row_ will describe the following for each part of the game:
- The environment or setting
- The characters and things
- The type of gameplay which takes place there (_for games_)
- What a player has to do or can do there (_for games_)
- What is happening in the project's narrative


#### Columns
The columns in the chart provide the structure for describing this important information. In the template, these include:

- **Location/sequence name**: The title for the row which describe where the events take place.
- **Time of day/Weather/Mood**: What is the mood and/or setting for these events? Useful for art production.
- **Brief Description of Events**: A brief description of what happens at this point, both from interactive and narrative perspectives (if appropriate). _Keep it brief._
- **Player Mechanics**: What actions are available to a player at this point in the game? This should highlight not only new and novel mechanics, but _all things_ a player can do here. Useful for designing gameplay.
- **Characters encountered**: All of the characters a player encounters in this part of the project. This is _every character_, not just NPCs.
- **Things Encountered**: What things are found in this part of the project? These might be gameplay related or narrative focused things.
- **Other Assets**: The audio, visual art, and animation needed to flesh out this part of the project. Often related to things in the background. This is a good place to note anything which may be time-consuming to create.
- **Audio Notes**: What kinds of sounds or music will be needed in this part of the project?
- **Visual Effects Notes**: What are the major visual effects (post-processing, particles, shaders, etc) needed in this part? Also a good place to note anything which may be time-consuming to create.
- **Player Goal**: These are the goals players set for themselves based on the cues they get from the game. What do you expect a player to want to do, or think they should be doing, in this part of the game?
- **Design Goal**: These are what you as the designer are trying to accomplish in this part of the project. For example: are we teaching the participant something, testing their ability, or introducing them to a key character, revealing something that marks an important part in the plot?
- **Emotional Beat**: 
What would you like a participant to be feeling in this part of the project? While we can't _make_ someone feel something, we can make design decisions to encourage certain emotions. [Dr. Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions](https://www.6seconds.org/2022/03/13/plutchik-wheel-emotions/) might be a good resource for identifying emotions.

## Burndown Chart
Your project's design macro provides a highly detailed and prioritized  list that can be used to help manage development tasks which still need to be completed. 

A simple, effective, and _highly visual_ approach to this, often referred to as a _burndown chart_, only requires striking off any completed task as it is completed. 

## 1-on-1/Team meetings
This week I will continue checking in with everyone. Please have your task list available.

# Homework

## Design Macro (Draft) for GMD/IA related projects
Continue developing a design macro for your project. You will ba asked to complete this in class next week. For non-game or interactive projects, you are welcome to also create a macro for your work! It's a beneficial tool for tracking your work. 

__Email me a link to the design macro by the start of class next week (GMD/IA related projects).__

## Continue Research and Development
Be prepared to demonstrate (not just talk about) progress next week in our breakout meetings.

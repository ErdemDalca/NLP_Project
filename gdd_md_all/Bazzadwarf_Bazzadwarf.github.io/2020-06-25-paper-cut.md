*A high-speed One Hit kill brawler*

Paper Cut was created as part of the Final Major Project module using Unreal Engine at Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies.

Paper Cut marked the first full game that I had produced using Unreal Engine. As such, this project involved learning how to combine all the skills that I had learned during my time at Confetti into a singular game. We worked together as a team to design a comprehensive Game Design Document that served as a guiding light for the game's development. For the project, my focus was on the level design, character movement, and game state tracking.

## Games Design Doc

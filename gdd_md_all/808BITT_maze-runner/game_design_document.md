# Maze Runner - Game Design Document

## Game Overview

Maze Runner is a top-down 2D maze exploration game where players must navigate through a complex maze while strategically uncovering as little of the map as possible. The game features a fog-of-war mechanic on the minimap, which gradually reveals areas as the player explores them. The unique twist is that players are rewarded for leaving more of the map unexplored, encouraging careful planning and efficient navigation.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Maze Generation

- Procedurally generated mazes to ensure replayability
- Various difficulty levels affecting maze complexity and size
- Maze contains a starting point and a goal/exit point
- Potential for obstacles, traps, and strategic decision points

### Fog of War Mechanic

- Players start with a completely fogged minimap
- Areas around the player are automatically revealed as they explore
- Revealed areas remain visible on the minimap
- The primary challenge is to reach the goal while revealing minimal map area

### Economy System

- Unexplored fog converts to coins upon maze completion
- Formula: `coins_earned = percentage_of_fog_remaining * base_coin_value`
- Higher difficulty levels offer better coin conversion rates
- Performance-based bonuses (completion time, paths taken, etc.)

### Player Upgrades

- Stats
  - Movement speed
  - Vision range (affects how much fog is cleared per step)
  - Special abilities cooldowns
  - Stamina/Energy capacity
- Cosmetics
  - Character skins
  - Trail effects
  - Minimap themes
  - UI customization

## Game Modes

### Single Player (Initial Focus)

- Campaign mode with progressively difficult mazes
- Time trials and challenge modes
- Daily/weekly procedural mazes with leaderboards

### Future Game Modes

- **Battle Royale**
  - Multiple players in the same maze
  - Competitive race to the exit
  - Power-ups and items to hinder opponents
  - Last player standing mechanics
  
- **Tactical Team Mode**
  - Team-based maze completion
  - Different player roles with unique abilities
  - Strategic fog clearing and information sharing
  - Cooperative objectives within the maze

## Technical Architecture

### Server Components

- User authentication and account management
- Maze generation algorithms
- Game state management and persistence
- Leaderboards and statistics
- Future multiplayer session management
- Economy system and transaction processing
- Player data storage and retrieval

### Client Components

- 2D rendering engine for the maze and player
- User interface including minimap with fog of war
- Input handling and player controls
- Audio system for game sounds and music
- Asset management for character skins and upgrades
- Menu system including game modes (with placeholders for future modes)
- Network communication with server

## User Interface

### Main Menu

- Single Player (active)
- Battle Royale (coming soon)
- Tactical Team (coming soon)
- Character Customization
- Settings
- Leaderboards

### In-Game UI

- Minimap with fog of war visualization
- Current position and orientation indicator
- Progress tracker (percentage of maze completed)
- Fog remaining indicator
- Timer
- Pause menu
- Power-up/ability indicators (where applicable)

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Single Player Experience

- Single player game loop
- Economy system foundation

### Phase 2: Enhancement and Polish

- Advanced maze algorithms
- Character upgrades and progression
- UI/UX improvements
- Sound and visual effects
- Additional single player challenges

### Phase 3: Multiplayer Foundation

- Server architecture for multiplayer
- Basic multiplayer functionality
- Account system improvements

### Phase 4: Extended Game Modes

- Battle Royale mode

- Advanced multiplayer features

## Art Style and Visual Direction

- Clean, readable top-down 2D graphics
- Distinctive visual language for maze elements
- Cohesive color scheme for UI elements
- Clear visual feedback for fog of war mechanics
- Appealing character designs suitable for diverse skins

## Technical Considerations

- Cross-platform support for web browsers initially, with potential for mobile adaptation
- Efficient server-client communication for future multiplayer modes
- Scalable architecture to support additional features and game modes
- Optimized fog of war calculations to support large mazes

*C#, Unity. &nbsp; 2021*

#### <a href="/Inn_Conspicuous_GDD.pdf">Inn-Conspicuous</a>
*Document. &nbsp; 2019*

A Game Design Document for a planned, cryptid-themed MMORPG. This was a project for an Intro to Software Engineering class during my senior year of high school. While the game never left the early stages of development, I led the creation of a game design document to organize, plan, and design what we wanted the game to look like. You can check out the (somewhat completed) GDD <a href="/Inn_Conspicuous_GDD.pdf">here.</a>

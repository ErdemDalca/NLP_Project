Jackpot Knockout is a 1980's themed, 2.5D beat em up game wherein players will face the ultimate challenge of survival. Set within a high-stakes TV show; with both single player and coop; you play a character with the goal of emerging victorious and claiming the life-changing prize of 50 million dollars. However, as the battle progresses, the situation appears to be far more sinister than initially thought...

Describing itself as an over the top, parody take on the retro-style beat 'em up genre; JK strives to combine comedic elements alongside unending action to provide players with a unique and memorable experience.

## Competitive research

Our game is inspired by popular classics in the beat 'em up genre; such as the renowned Streets of Rage franchise, the amazing Double Dragon Gaiden and lastly, the nostalgic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge.

To that extent, we have taken several classic mechanics from these games and adapted them into our own. These include, but are not limited to; the combo system, grabs, throw attacks and the healing system.

Additionally, utilizing what we have learned from these games, we have been carefully adjusting the feel of both our combat and movement system to match the level of polish felt in some of these beloved classic games.

## Mechanics

Starting off the Mechanics, the game features a 2.5D movement style where the player is able to move on a plane with both the width (horizontal axis) and depth (vertical axis) directions. For each movement in the vertical axis, we also update the Z coordinate, utilizing it to create 2.5D effect wherein you are only able to hit enemies with similar depth. The player is also able to perform a dash, a quick movement in any direction which provides the player with invincibility frames and lets them either get close to or away from an enemy.

Moving onto the combat, the player is able to perform 2 distinct types of attacks; with one being a standard combo and the other being a "special" grab and throw attack. The standard attack combo works by cycling through several different attack animations. Each time the attack button is pressed, the character performs the next hit of the queue. However, when the player doesn't hit anyone or doesn't press the button after a certain period of time, the attack combo is reset. 

The grab and throw on the other hand, consists of the player grabbing an enemy and being able to throw them within a certain time period, dealing significant damage. However, to offset this powerful move, the grab part of the move takes a certain amount of health away from the player, creating a risk-reward scenario where one cannot simply spam the attack.

Since each attack comes with their own attack values and distinct hitboxes, each attack has a defined length and move set. The player is supposed to learn how to time and utilize their moves correctly to maximize their damage and achieve optimal performance.

Similarly to the player, all enemies will contain within them their own unique attack combos. Alongside this, each enemy fits a certain "niche". For example, while the basic enemy is quite self-explanatory, we also have someone like the TNT Thrower which fills the role of a ranged AOE attacker and the Bodyguard is able to pick the player up and throw them.

The boss takes this a step further however; including alongside his own combo a varied repertoire of "special" moves. 
An example of this would be the Presenter having a special ranged attack wherein he throws casino chips at supersonic speed at the player from a distance.

Essentially, the game features a wide array of different enemies and a boss, each with their unique attack patterns and methods of attack; be it ranged or melee. 

Additionally, as any good beat 'em up, the game will feature certain healing items that will heal the player on pickup. These will be commonly found when destroying a destructible object, such as a slot machine or a storage box. While enemies are also able to destroy these objects, they are unable to utilize the heal pickup. The healing item also does not respawn as to ensure a fair constant difficulty.

## Characters

### Players

In terms of playable characters, our game will feature a single main playable character, the Kickboxer, who is playable in both single and co-op play.

Starting off with the Kickboxer, he is your typical beat 'em up protagonist; a melee fighter based on mostly punches with a few kicks mixed in between for variety. He is designed accordingly with most common character archetypes in order to offer players with a familiar yet fun playstyle choice. Design wise, the character portrays a nonchalant, almost chill and relaxed personality with a hint of cockiness; wearing a mix of streetwear and casual clothing whilst destroying anyone in his path.

### Enemies

Regarding enemies, we have selected a small, curated selection of distinct enemies, each with their own special method of attack.These include:

A basic melee Light and Medium enemy, each attacking the player with either faster, lighter attacks or heavier, slower attacks respectively. These act as the basic "Goons" of our game, enabling the player to learn their controls and test out their combat system upon first encounters.

A TNT launcher which launches an AOE dynamite sticks which explodes after a short delay, sending players flying. This enemy serves as a long-range AOE to avoid getting hit by and to focus on eliminating as soon as possible to avoid being overwhelmed.

A Bodyguard which picks players up and launches them flying into walls, stunning them upon their landing. This enemy serves as a skill-check as their grab ability must be avoided whilst trying to succesfuly defeat them.

A Heavy enemy jumps near players, stunning and damaging them upon landing their jump attack. This enemy serves as a second AOE attack dealer, albeit this time with a slightly larger radius and being slightly harder to avoid, requiring players to coordinate their move-sets correctly to defeat them without issues.

All this enemies will be very similar design-wise, with a comedic tone to its inividual varitiations (the heavy enemy is fat, the bodyguard wears a suit and sunglasses, the tnt launcher has a very large hat, etc.)

### Bosses

Regarding Boss enemy; The Presenter is the magnum opus of the game. As Its final Villain. The Presenter consists of an eccentric, well dressed man in his late 40's with an iconic smile, irradiating an aura of both confidence, charisma and a slight hint of psychopathy as this game's main Antagonist. Serving as a cunning mastermind, The Presenter toys with the player in the first phase, attacking them with a Cane and Throwing Chips from the casino, doing a moderately-heavy amount of damage.

However, once the player manages to get past this first phase, the presenter will move on towards a new battlefield, wherein he will unsheathe his cane into a beautiful sword, utilizing it to deal significantly more damage, complete with a new special attack wherein he dash attacks the player, stunning them upon hit and dealing heavy damage.

## Environments

The game will happen on a single casino-themed TV set level and will be divided into different scenes. Once all the enemies on the scene are defeated, the door will be opened and the players will be allowed to pass to the next scene.

The scenes in the game are going to be relatively small and will have enemies that spawn through different doors located through the level. There will also be destructibles through the scene that can be picked up by the player.

At the end of the game, a Boss fight will take place. This fight will consist of a singular unique boss along side with some regular enemies. Upon completion of the fight, the player will get their health completely restored. 

## Narrative

Set within the intense and unpredictable confines of a high-stakes television show, the protagonist’s singular goal is to emerge victorious and claim a life-changing prize of $50 million. This is in itself the basis of the narrative; a high-stakes game show wherein the only rule is the survival of the fittest.

However, as the layers of the competition unravel, so too does the truth behind the show, making the stakes more personal — and dangerous —  than initially anticipated. For The Presenter and his show are far more sinister in their intentions than initially seemed to be, peeling away layer by layer as the player goes further in into the dark and twisted reality of this so called "show".

Having uncovered the truth—that the grand prize was nothing more than a lie—the protagonist's final challenge becomes a fight for survival. No longer just a contestant, they tear through the ranks of those who orchestrate the show, cutting down everyone standing in their way. At the heart of it all awaits The Presenter, the mastermind behind the deception. In one last, brutal confrontation, the protagonist must defeat him, escape the facility, and reclaim what was rightfully promised.

## Art

When it comes to the Art Style of the game, Jackpot Knockout utilizes a simple yet deliberately nostalgic and imperfect pixel art aesthetic, choosing to opt for a low-pixel look which further immerses players into its otherwise visually striking, 1980's inspired world; blending retro-futurism, realism and bizarre comedic elements in a an almost surreal atmosphere oozing with nostalgia. It engages players though vibrant visuals mixed with an unconventional tone, exploring its aesthetic mainly through environmental storytelling.

It relies on detailed backdrops and interactive element to convey its narrative, capturing the appeal and charm of retro gaming with a modern twist, drawing players further and further into its quirky, high-stakes world.  The single level is rooted in the high-energy ambiance of a casino merged with the chaos of a TV studio, providing a dynamic and memorable setting that enhances the game’s identity.

This non-pixel-perfect approach captures the charm of retro gaming without adhering strictly to the limitations of classic hardware, resulting in a distinctive style that blends familiarity with innovation. The vibrant color palette, exaggerated character animations, and carefully designed environments amplify the surreal tone of the game, further serving as an element of style to keep players immersed and engaged in this wonderful world. With a large array of distinct props and items, the game is sure to catch the eye of many retro gamer enthusiasts on its unique style alone.

## Audio

### SFX

Every Move in the game will have a unique audio that provides feedback to the game. When dealing damage to a character, a hit cue will also be played. The hit cue will be different for enemies and for players so that it can be easily recognized when the hit has been received by the player or by the enemy without having to look to the health bar.

In order to avoid monotony, each hit sound will have a slight variation on the pitch, making them more dynamic.

When the combo has a value greater than 10, a sound cue will also exist letting you know that you have a high combo amount.

Other environmental sound effects will be through the whole game to improve the user experience when interacting with the world. An example of that will be the door of the scene opening, the player breaking a destructible, a health pick-up being in the ground waiting to be collected, the player picking up a health pick-up...

## Interface

### HUD

The HUD present in the game is going to be simple as there won't be many things on the screen at once. All of the information will be on the top part of the UI.

The most important information on the HUD is going to be the Health bar that will indicate the remaining health each player has at any moment of the game. If the players are using the co-op mode of the game, two health bars (one on the top left and other on the top right) will appear, showing the current health of each of the players. When a boss fight happens, another health bar will appear on the bottom part of the screen showing the boss name and its current health.

In addition to the health bar, a combo indicator will be present on the UI. This will indicate the current amounts of hits in your current combo. If your combo is less than 10 hits, this value will not appear on the screen. Lastly, we will also have a Score system with a Score bar in the centre top of the screen, representing the current amount of cash your character has.

# Project Plan Template: Top-Down Shooter Prototype

## 1. Executive Summary

The Top-Down Shooter Prototype project aims to develop a functional prototype that encapsulates the essential gameplay mechanics critical for player engagement and enjoyment. This project will focus on creating a small, playable map that allows for the testing of key features such as player movement dynamics, aiming precision, shooting mechanics, and enemy spawning behavior. By implementing basic enemy AI, we will simulate interactions with the player, providing a more immersive testing experience. The primary objective is to validate game concepts and ensure that the foundational elements of the game are enjoyable and functional. Key outcomes include a playable prototype that can be tested by a select group of players, feedback collection for iterative improvements, and a comprehensive report on the prototype's performance. This project serves as a crucial step before advancing to full-scale production, ensuring that the game mechanics resonate with the target audience and meet industry standards.

## 2. Detailed Scope of Work

- **Game Design Document (GDD)**: Create a comprehensive GDD outlining the gameplay mechanics, player controls, and enemy behaviors.
- **Prototype Development**: Develop a functional prototype using a suitable game engine (e.g., Unity or Unreal Engine).
  - **Player Mechanics**: Implement player movement, aiming, and shooting mechanics.
  - **Enemy AI**: Design and implement basic enemy AI to interact with the player.
  - **Map Design**: Create a small, playable map that facilitates gameplay testing.
- **Testing Phase**: Conduct internal testing to identify bugs and gameplay issues.
- **Feedback Collection**: Organize a playtest session with a select group of players to gather feedback on gameplay mechanics.
- **Iteration and Improvement**: Analyze feedback and make necessary adjustments to the prototype.
- **Final Report**: Compile a report detailing the prototype's performance, player feedback, and recommendations for future development.

# Project Plan Template: Social Impact Simulation Game

## 1. Executive Summary

The Social Impact Simulation Game project aims to develop an innovative and engaging game concept that immerses players in the complexities of social decision-making. The primary objective is to create a simulation that challenges players to navigate various scenarios requiring effective resource management while addressing pressing social issues and stimulating economic growth within virtual communities. Key outcomes of this project include the development of diverse characters representing different societal roles, compelling storylines that reflect real-world challenges, and gameplay mechanics designed to foster critical thinking and empathy. By allowing players to experience the consequences of their decisions on community well-being, the game seeks to entertain while simultaneously raising awareness about social impact. The final deliverables will include comprehensive documentation of game mechanics, character development, and visual style, ensuring that the concept is both engaging and educational.

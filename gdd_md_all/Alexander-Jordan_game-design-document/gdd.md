Describe the story with anything between a hook/logline (1-3 sentences) or a synopsis (500-800 words), and include important characters and events.

The story is the raw content - events, actions, and characters arranged in chronological order. Answer these 2 questions: who are these people, and what happened to them?

#### Example story for **Halo**:
> **Logline:**
> _A super-soldier and his AI companion must stop an alien alliance from using a powerful ancient weapon to destroy humanity._

> **Synopsis:**
> _Set in the 26th century, the story follows Master Chief, a Spartan super-soldier, and Cortana, his AI companion, as they crash-land on a mysterious ringworld called Halo.
> They discover the alien Covenant plans to use Halo’s power as a weapon, threatening all life in the galaxy.
> As they explore Halo, they uncover the ring’s true purpose as a prison for the Flood, a parasitic species.
> Master Chief must stop both the Covenant and the Flood by destroying Halo, ensuring the survival of humanity._

## Narrative

Write a narrative that's anything between a hook/logline (1-3 sentences) or a synopsis (500-800 words), and include important characters and events.

How is the story told? What is the PoV? Is it in chronological order or non-linear? How/When is important information revealed?

#### Example narrative for **Halo**:
> **Logline:**
> _The story unfolds through Master Chief’s experiences, blending action, environmental storytelling, and Cortana’s commentary to guide players through the conflict._

> **Synopsis:**
> _The narrative begins with the human ship Pillar of Autumn fleeing a Covenant attack, leading to its crash on Halo.
> Told mostly through Master Chief’s perspective, the story reveals Halo’s secrets as players explore the ring’s environments, interact with allies, and face enemies.
> Cortana provides exposition, explaining the Covenant’s fanaticism and Halo’s origins.
> Flashbacks and dialogue with key characters like Captain Keyes deepen the mystery, culminating in a desperate race to prevent Halo’s activation._

## Plot

Write a plot that's anything between a hook/logline (1-3 sentences) or a synopsis (500-800 words), and include important characters and events.

Why and how are events connected? What is the cause for one event to lead to another, and what is the purpose? What is the logic and motivation behind the sequence of events?

#### Example plot for **Halo**:
> **Logline:**
> _Master Chief must destroy Halo to prevent both the Covenant and the Flood from annihilating humanity._

> **Synopsis:**
> _The plot centers on Master Chief’s mission to survive on Halo while uncovering its true purpose.
> Initially tasked with defending humanity from the Covenant, the discovery of the Flood shifts the stakes, forcing him to ally with human survivors and AI allies.
> The climax sees Master Chief infiltrating the ring’s control center to destroy Halo by overloading the Pillar of Autumn’s reactor, narrowly escaping before the ring is obliterated.
> The plot ties together themes of survival, sacrifice, and the dangers of wielding ancient technology._

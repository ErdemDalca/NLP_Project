# Battlefield Respawn Project #
A Project Reality (Refractor 2) data compatible Game recreation

## What is this Project ##

The Battlefield Respawn Project is an effort to create a free and open source recreation of the Refractor & Refractor 2 Game Engine.
The Refractor Game Engine's are famous for having powered most of the Original Battlefield Games such as:

* Battlefield 1942
* Battlefield Vietnam
* Battlefield 2
* Battlefield 2142
* Battlefield Heroes
* Battlefield Play 4 Free

All of these titles (with the exception of the last 2) are now over 10 years old and considered abandonware since DICE/EA have shut down all original GameSpy powered online servers and ceased use of the Refractor 2 engine in favour of the more capable Frostbite engine.

Many Battlefield games, in particular Battlefield 2 still have an active modding community supporting projects such as Project Reality and Forgotten Hope 2.
However the modding efforts of these Community Projects can only go so far given the aging capabilities of the Refractor 2 engine.

To Solve this the Battlefield Respawn Project aims to create a data compatible game engine of a modern standard with new features and rendering methods.

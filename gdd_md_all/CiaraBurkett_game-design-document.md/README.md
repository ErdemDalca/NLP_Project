# Game Design Document
## Converted to Markdown

The following is a link to a [game design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ct5-qyUZC9cAKn-iLUgtOczDkERmPzNNwPLDfT9Hgjs/preview) created in Google Docs. I use Markdown with [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) for a majority of my word processing needs, so here it is. Each section in the index is an anchor that links to the corresponding item. The "Schedule" section includes a table for weekly planning.

## Usage

If you're familiar with git, paste the following in the command line, making changes where necessary:

1. `git clone https://github.com/CiaraBurkett/game-design-document.md.git [optional: your document name]`
2. git remote remove origin

Otherwise, download the zip file.

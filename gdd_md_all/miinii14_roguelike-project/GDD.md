# INTRODUCTION
This document describes my roguelike game written on python using pygame library. Even though its roguelike, there are still some new mechanics, which will make this game different from others. (no name for now xD)

## MAIN IDEA
There is no lore. It means that you have to write your own history by yourself.
Before the start you will choose the race. Each race will have its own unique abiliteis and starting equipment.
For now, the whole map is made of 5 different floars full of different rooms. In order to make it to the next level, you should kill the boss, which will be randomly spawned in one of the rooms. And, as you guessed, killing the final boss will mean the end of the game. Good luck on your path ;P

## MAIN CHARACTER

### RACE AND CLASS
As i've mentioned, before the start you will be asked to choose the race. But what about the class, you may ask? The answer is simple - there is no class choice. By using different types of weapons, staffs, magic etc., yours skills will gradually increase. It means, that you can choose your own class or even try to combine them.

### STATS
Health, mana and action points. Nothing more to say 

## GAME MECHANICS

### GAMING MODES
There are two different gaming modes: peacefull and fighting mode. The peacefull mode is activated when there are no enemies around. It allows to move freely and use all of the items in the inventory. Fighting mode activates the action points. Basically each action, such as moving, shooting, attacking, using potions etc, will have its own action points. By the end of the points the turn would be headed to the AI. You can pre end the turn as well. There is also a posibility to run away from the fight with a certain chance, which depends on the different things.

### QUESTS AND TRADERS
Quests and traders are going to be spawned randomly. For completing the quests you will be rewarded with gold or/and equipment. Gold is obviously used to buy items from trader. Simple, isn't it?

## MAP GENERATING
As I said, there are 5 different floars full of rooms and corridors. There are a lot of types of these rooms: 
1. Trader room
2. Regular mobs room
3. Trap room
4. Boss room
5. Rest room
6. Quiz room

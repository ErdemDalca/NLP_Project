### Theme/Setting/Genre
A 3D top-down orthogonal reverse-horror factory crafting game.

### Design Pillars
- Thing - Stuff.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief
- Thing - Stuff.

### Ideas
Veins transport blood -> hearts pump blood -> blood transports compounds -> blood circulates back to heart
Ex. blood transports oxygen as a compound
capillaries distribute blood to organs and muscles

blood is necessary for transporting oxygen and nutrients (water and food are nutrients)

water and (digested) food must pass through intestines to be absorbed into the blood stream

the blood stream deposits waste material into the kidneys, which exists through urine

the blood stream also deposits waste carbon dioxide into the lungs which will need to be exhaled

the game loop will likely dumb down or neglect some of these necessities early on at the cost of efficiency, but later game components will require more and more of the full cycle to be functional and effective

DEBATE: should blood import and export veins from the heart be separate elements or should they be ingrained in the same element?

smaller veins could be self contained circulators but large aortas and vena cava would have to be manually circulated

Trachea transport gases -> lungs pump gases
Ex. lungs breath in mass quantities of oxygen gas
orifices are openings to extract and exhale gases
orifices and sphincters (perhaps later variety) can be configured to change their throughput either internally to restrict the flow of material or externally to adjust the pressure at which a gas, liquid, or item is ejected (for example: igniters could be used just outside of a high pressure orifice that ejects methane, or even just a corrosive liquid for that matter)

main lungs are used for absorbing oxygen/other gases and for exhaling carbon dioxide/other waste gases

auxiliary lungs are used purely for pumping gases without absorbing them

lungs will have diminishing effectiveness over longer distances

Esophagi transport items and liquid
Ex. esophagi muscularly maneuver biomass and liquids through themselves
esophagi require blood flow

sphincters will act as the end of "pipes" where excess gas or liquid will spill and items eject but also act as the interfaces to organs

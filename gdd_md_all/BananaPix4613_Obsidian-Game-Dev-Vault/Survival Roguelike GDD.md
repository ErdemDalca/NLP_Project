### Theme/Setting/Genre
3D survival horror roguelike taking place in a remote pine forest with ps1/ps2 visuals. Theme is unknown as of yet but there is the idea of the player leaning into madness as each run progresses.

### Design Pillars
- Scarcity - The player should always be on the verge of starvation and even in the event of a fortuitous hunt the player should always face the inevitable reminder that they will go hungry again. Even when it comes to weapons, the player will face perils that will run their ammunition dry whether it be a bow or a rifle.
- Exploration - The player is encouraged to explore further and further from their camp to scavenge for materials and hunt for food. There is a plethora of strange discoveries to be had in the shifting layout of the forest.
- Survival - The player is pushed to extremes to maintain their stats to extend their life whether it be maintaining their health with bandages and splints or staving off their hunger with hunted boar or rotten flesh.
- Mystique and Fear - The forest is filled with strange structures and occurrences that illicit both curiosity and fear out of the player to entice them to explore deeper and deeper into the woods to discover activity from both the occult and cryptid.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief
- Shifting World - Every successful night survived the surrounding forest will shift its layout and procedurally generate new rooms. As the amount of time the player persists increases or if the player remains paranoid for long enough, the rooms generated will reflect the changes experienced or items held.
- Permadeath - If the player dies they die. That's it. There is no meta progression between runs. All runs are self contained when it comes to progression, except for knowledge obtained by the player.
- Items - Whether awarded at the end of a night or found while exploring there are stackable items that provide bonuses to stats, 
- Equipment - Equipment are items that can actively be used by the player by means of a hotbar of sorts. They can range from active equipment like a knife, lighter, or rifle, the latter needing ammo, to passive equipment like a flashlight, map, or compass.
- Weight - Every piece of equipment and item has their own associated weight values. Weight scales with how powerful the equipment or item is. Depending on the total weight carried by the player, it will effect the player's movement speed and the rate at which their hunger depletes.
- Health - The player's highest priority is maintaining their health pool. If their health drops to zero the die. The player can maintain their health and even slowly regenerate it by keeping their hunger bar full. The player can also use bandages, splints, and (mysterious) syringes that they may find to (potentially) heal themselves.
- Hunger - The player's second highest priority is maintaining their hunger. 
- Sanity -

# Milestone 2 : Produce a Game Design Document (GDD)


## **Game OverView**

**Core Concept:**

In this uneasy and emotionally charged 3D game *No More Chains*, you step into the paws of a stray cat desperately trying to escape from a house where your owner and his child constantly abuse you. *No More Chains* immerses you in a first-person perspective, allowing you to experience the world directly through the cat's eyes. As you navigate through dark, unsettling environments with several puzzles, stealth-based challenges, and dangerous situations, your goal is to secretly escape from the owner and his child, who will abuse you on sight. The game revolves around your struggle for survival, where you must think strategically and act quickly to find your way to freedom in a limited time. The emotional narrative drives the gameplay, evoking empathy as you face the cat's fears and challenges, making each decision crucial in your escape attempt.

**Related Genre(s):**

No More Chains falls into the adventure and puzzle genres, with elements of stealth and survival. It shares similarities with games like *Stray, Inside* and *Little Nightmares*. Comparing our game with Stray, though it appears both of the games falls into the same element of a stray cat exploring mysterious scenes and solving puzzles, the main concepts are to be differentiated through *No More Chains* focuses on the emotional narrative of an abused animal, house-bond setting and escaping for freedom in a first-person perspective. Unlike many other games, the emphasis here is on the psychological aspect of escape and the challenges faced by an animal in a hostile environment.

**Target Audience:**

The game is aimed at players who enjoy emotionally engaging narratives, puzzle-solving, and stealth mechanics, plus those who appreciate games that challenge their empathy towards stray animals and offer thought-provoking experiences. Here are mainly 5 groups of target audiences:

1. **Animal lovers:** People who are passionate about animal welfare or who enjoy content centered around animals would likely be drawn to this game. The emotional storyline and the perspective of a vulnerable animal can resonate strongly with this audience, eager to set the cat free.
2. **Fans of Story-Driven Games:** Players who appreciate deep, narrative-driven games that go beyond standard gameplay mechanics and offer an emotional experience would find this game engaging. No More Chains may capture similar audiences of *Journey* or *The Last Guardian*.
3. **Fans of Puzzle and Stealth:** Fans of puzzle and stealth genres would be attracted to the challenge of navigating the cat through dangerous environments and solving creative problems to escape.
4. **Indie Game Supporters:** Indie game fans often seek out unique, emotionally engaging experiences that larger studios might not explore. This game, played directly on the website with no downloads required and a small file size (under 250MB), emphasizes a strong narrative and psychological depth. It appeals to those who enjoy indie titles that offer something different, focusing on the storyline and emotional connection rather than heavy graphics or complex mechanics.
5. **Socially Conscious Gamers:** Gamers interested in titles that address social issues (in this case, abuses of cats), whether directly or through metaphor, would likely find the game appealing. The subtle yet powerful message about animal welfare could attract those who appreciate games that make a statement or spark conversation.-

**Unique Selling Points (USPs):**

1. **First-Person Feline Perspective:** No More Chains offers a unique first-person experience as a stray cat, immersing players in the emotional and psychological struggle of escaping abuse. This perspective deepens the connection to the protagonist and sets the game apart from titles like Stray.
2. **Claustrophobic Atmosphere:** Set entirely within a confined, eerie house, the game heightens tension and stakes through tight spaces and constant threats. The claustrophobic environment makes every decision critical, especially with the added pressure of time limits.
3. **Lightweight and Accessible:** With a small, web-based file size under 250MB, No More Chains offers easy accessibility without sacrificing depth. Multiple endings based on player decisions add replayability and keep the experience engaging.
4. **Social Commentary on Animal Welfare:** The game subtly addresses issues like animal abuse and welfare, delivering a powerful message through its narrative. It appeals to socially conscious gamers by allowing them to empathize with a vulnerable animal's plight.
5. **Targeted Niche Audience:** No More Chains is designed for narrative-driven, emotionally engaging gameplay, appealing to animal lovers, indie game enthusiasts, and socially conscious gamers, ensuring a passionate player base.


## **Story and Narrative**

**Backstory:** *No More Chains* is set in a dim house that exudes an unsettling atmosphere. The house is lived by a cruel man and his equally unkind child, both having a history of abusing animals. You play as a stray cat that once was a homeless cat living on the street, then has been caught by the cruel man and has been trapped in this house for some time, enduring the daily torment and abuse from the owner and his kid. The main conflict centers around your desperate attempt to escape the house and use your intelligence to fight for freedom. The game’s narrative unfolds gradually as you navigate through different parts of the house, uncovering clues about the way to freedom and piecing together the events that led to your current predicament.

As you progress, the story reveals that the owner and his child’s cruelty stems from a cycle of abuse and neglect that they themselves have endured. However, the game doesn't excuse their behavior but instead highlights the tragic consequences of a toxic environment. The deeper you delve into the house, the more you uncover about the owner’s abuse of animals, and the more urgent your escape becomes.

The story unfolds through environmental storytelling, such as scattered notes, photographs, and hidden objects, as well as through the reactions of the owner and his child. The tension builds as you come closer to escaping, with the narrative climaxing in a final confrontation where you must outsmart your captors once and for all, so that there are NO MORE CHAINS.

**Characters:**

1. **The Stray Cat (Player):**
    - **Background:** You are a stray cat who once lived on the streets, free but always struggling to find food and safety. Unfortunately, you were caught by the cruel owner and brought into this house, where you've endured nothing but suffering. Your only goal is to escape and find freedom once again.
    - **Motivation:** Survival and escape. You want to break free from the chains of abuse and regain your lost freedom.
    - **Personality:** The cat is resilient, resourceful, and determined. Despite the fear and pain, it never gives up hope of escaping.
    - **Appearance:** A small, scruffy cat with visible signs of mistreatment, such as a torn ear or matted fur.
2. **The Owner (Villain):**
    - **Background:** The owner is a bitter, middle-aged priest who projects his frustrations and anger onto those weaker than him, especially animals. His abusive nature stems from his own troubled past, where he experienced neglect and cruelty. However, this doesn't justify his actions, as he has chosen to continue the cycle of abuse rather than break it.
    - **Motivation:** Eager to find dominance and feeling of control. The owner seeks to exert power over the cat, using cruelty as a way to feel in control.
    - **Personality:** The owner is cold, calculated, and cruel. He shows no remorse for his actions and views the cat as nothing more than a nuisance to be controlled.
    - **Appearance:** A disheveled, intimidating figure with harsh features. He wears old, stained clothing, and his presence in the game is often signaled by ominous sounds or shadows.
3. **The Child (Secondary Antagonist):**
    - **Background:** The child, having grown up in a toxic environment, mimics the behavior of the father. Though younger and less physically imposing, the child is just as cruel and enjoys tormenting the cat for entertainment. The child represents the perpetuation of the cycle of abuse.
    - **Motivation:** Amusement and attention. The child finds pleasure in hurting the cat and seeks approval from the father by doing so.
    - **Personality:** The child is a mix of innocence corrupted by cruelty. There's a sense of lost potential, as the child could have been different if raised in a loving environment.
    - **Appearance:** A small, pale child with a cold, distant expression. The child often carries toys that are used to hurt the cat.
                

**Plot Progression:**

- **Introduction:** The game begins with the cat locked in a small room in the basement. This sets the tone for the game as the player immediately has to find a way out without being seen.
- **Mid-Game:** As the player progresses, they encounter various obstacles like being in danger of man's attacks, and various interactable objects to solve puzzles, uncovering more about the backstory of the owner and his child. The tension escalates as the player comes closer to escape, but the threats increase as well.
- **Climax:** In the final stages of the game, the cat faces its greatest challenge, the way to the frontgate without being caught by the owner. The climax is filled with suspense as every move could mean either escape or capture.
- **Resolution:** The ending of the game is represented as a picture of cat leisurely watching the sunset, leaving players with a sense of relief mixed with the unsettling realization that the cycle may continue for others.


## **Gameplay and Mechanics**

### **Perspective and Camera**

- **First-Person Perspective:** "No More Chains" employs a first-person perspective to enhance the player's immersion, emphasizing the vulnerability and immediacy of the cat's situation. This viewpoint fosters a direct connection with the cat’s emotions and challenges, amplifying the tension of the stealth and puzzle elements.
- **Gameplay Camera Dynamics:**
    - **Ground-Level View:** The camera stays low to the ground, mirroring the cat’s stature and perspective, making ordinary objects appear larger and more intimidating.
    - **Swaying Motion:** Emulating the cat's natural movements, the camera incorporates a slight sway when walking or running, adding realism and urgency to the navigation.
    - **Visibility:** The cat’s ears are visible in the camera, and its paws and fur occasionally come into view, particularly during actions like jumping or crouching, enhancing the sense of being in the cat’s body.

### **Controls**

- **Movement:**
    - W: Move forward.
    - A: Move left.
    - S: Move backward.
    - D: Move right.
    - Spacebar: Jump or climb when applicable.
- **Stealth Mechanics:**
    - Hold Shift to move faster, crucial for avoiding detection during stealth sections.
- **Interaction:**
    - E: Interact with objects (e.g., open unlocked doors, push items).
- **Special Controls:**
    - C: Crouch or hide under furniture.

### **Progress and Challenges**

- **Obstacle Navigation:** Jump over obstacles or squeeze through tight spaces using the spacebar. Some paths may be blocked or hazardous, requiring creative navigation or interaction with objects to clear the way.
- **Resource Management:** Find and use items scattered around the house that can aid in your escape. These might include keys and puzzles that gradually lead to the game success.
- **Game End/Success:** The game concludes when the cat find the key to the frontgate and successfully opens it.
- **Failure Mechanisms:** The player loses if the cat's life bar drops to 0, resulting in a restart from the beginning.


### **Core Game Mechanics**

- **Player Actions:**
    - Sneaking, jumping, interacting with the environment, and using items found around the house to solve puzzles.
- **Stealth:**
    - Avoid detection by moving quickly hiding. 
- **Puzzle Solving:**
    - Find objects with outline effetcs, engage with various elements in the house to solve puzzles that are necessary for unlocking escape routes. Puzzles may involve diversion tactics.
- **Environmental Interaction:**
    - The environment is laden with narrative clues like discarded notes or photographs that help piece together the backstory and motivations of the antagonists, enriching the game’s depth and providing context for the cat’s escape efforts.



## **Levels and World design**
### 3D Game Play
3D Games provides a more immersive experience, allowing players to explore the game world in multiple dimensions. It also offers more flexibility for developers to decide the camera view, alter the physics, and interaction with in-game objects (NPCs, things, etc.). A more immersive experience can better express the situation on what the character in the game is facing, which is crucial for the game's horror theme. 

*What we want from 3D Game Play:*
 - **Immersive Realism**: The game world should feel real and immersive, allowing players to feel like they are truly in the cat's shoes.

![horror_game_example_3D.GIF](Images/GIFs/horror_game_example_3D.GIF)*Visage, a 3D horror game. GIF From BiliBili, Author information included in GIF.*
 - **Freedom of Movement**: Players should be able to explore the environment freely, interacting with objects and NPCs in a realistic way.

![RDR2_Free_Movement.gif](Images/GIFs/RDR2_Free_Movement.gif)*Red Dead Redemption 2, a Rockstar Game.*
 - **Dynamic Interactions**: The game world should respond to the player's actions, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

![RDR2_Character_Interaction.gif](Images/GIFs/RDR2_Character_Interaction.gif)*Red Dead Redemption 2, a Rockstar Game.*

**No minimap in game play**: Since we are designing a game in small space, furthermore, the minimap may decrease the player's immersion. We decide to remove the minimap in the game play.

Consequently, we opted to develop the game in 3D, as this format provides the depth and richness of environment necessary to create an intense and frightening atmosphere that engages players on a deeper level.)

[//]: # (Overall, I consider first-person perspective a preferable option for our game, because it not only makes players easier to connect with the game’s world, but also makes players able to project themselves to the main character.

## **Art and Audio**
### **Art Style**

**Colors**

The palette should consist of muted, desaturated tones, conjuring a sense of decay and neglect. Dominated by grays, browns, and dirty whites, the environment should also feature occasional splashes of deep red or dark blue to heighten the sense of unease.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bfec2ee-a0f5-4525-99db-08a36ef25a26)


**Shapes** 

While rooted in realism, the shapes should have an unsettling quality—slightly exaggerated proportions or warped perspectives that induce disorientation. The boy’s character, for instance, should have subtly distorted features, like oversized eyes or a disturbing grin, to amplify his eerie presence.

</div>






**Textures**

Gritty and worn textures should define the environment. Walls may show peeling paint, floors might be scuffed and splintered, and furniture should appear aged and decrepit. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdb7b75d-c9a2-4cfc-9c53-ea5a420d4c90" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/></td>

  </tr>
</table>


The boy’s skin should be rough and dirty, with visible cracks and bruises, enhancing his menacing look,

 while the cat’s fur should appear matted and tattered, reflecting its struggle.

</div>


**Overall Aesthetics**

The overall atmosphere should evoke a profound sense of discomfort and unease. The environment should feel claustrophobic and confining, mirroring the cat’s plight. The house itself should seem to decay from within, a reflection of the twisted and corrupt nature of its inhabitants.

### Sound and Music

**Sounds**

The audio for "breathing-fast," "cat running," and "heartbeat" should blend in dynamically based on the cat's movement and proximity to threats, making each interaction feel immersive and tense.

/Assets/Audio/heartbeat

**Ambient Background Music**

The music centers on a continuous, low-frequency drone that subtly sets the background tone, always present to hint at looming danger. Sporadic, eerie strings add to the unsettling atmosphere, rising and falling unpredictably. This track creates moderate tension, making the player uneasy without overwhelming them. Silence is strategically used to heighten the atmosphere, with the absence of sound amplifying the player's sense of vulnerability.

/Assets/Audio/background music


**Threat Music (Villians Approaching)**

This track plays when the each of the NPCs approaches the cat, signaling immediate danger and prompting the player to act. The music becomes more intense, with louder, dissonant elements like sharp strings, aggressive percussion, and distorted effects. The pace quickens with abrupt changes that mirror the boy's unpredictable presence. This track greatly increases tension, using louder peaks and sharper sounds to alert the player to the boy’s proximity, urging them to evade or hide. The shift in sound cues the player to the heightened risk and the need to respond quickly.

## **User Interface (UI)**

### **Health Bar**

The health bar represents the cat’s remaining lives, shown as 5 small cat print icons, each representing one life. As the cat takes damage or gets caught by the boy or father, the prints fade, signaling the cat’s vulnerability. The health bar appears in the top right corner of the screen in a charcoal color, fading to pale grey as the cat’s health decreases, adding to the tension.

### **Threat Indicator:**

A vignetting effect is used to indicate threat when the boy or father is nearby. This effect appears around the edges of the screen, darkening and intensifying based on the proximity and level of danger. As the boy or father gets closer, the vignette deepens and spreads further into the screen, giving the player a visual cue to the increasing risk and prompting them to take evasive action. The effect seamlessly blends with the game's eerie atmosphere, enhancing the sense of danger without distracting from the gameplay.

**Menu Screens:**

The menu functions include pausing the game provides a quick reference for game controls. Additionally, the menu offers options to restart the current game session or to quit the game. 

The menus feature a worn, old-paper background with faded edges and subtle stains. The font is slightly uneven, and buttons and options are highlighted with a dim, flickering glow to guide the player’s focus without being too bright. Example of similar style of menu are provided below as a reference.

**In-Game Prompts and Interactions:**

Prompts appear when the cat can interact with objects, such as hiding spots or items. These prompts are minimalistic, displaying only a small icon indicating which key to press to interact. The prompts use the same typewriter-style font, with a subtle glow effect to indicate interactability. The icons are small and designed to blend into the environment, becoming visible only when the player is near an interactable object. Some examples from the game Stray are provided below as a reference.

## **Possible challenges**

1. Technical challenges: Challenge: Integrating complex mechanics like stealth, AI behavior (for the owner and child), and first-person controls for the cat could prove challenging within Unity, especially within a limited timeframe. Solution: a. Break down each complex mechanic into smaller tasks and implement them incrementally. Start with a basic version of the mechanic, then iterate to add complexity. b. Leverage Unity’s Asset Store for pre-built scripts or assets that can simplify complex mechanics. Additionally, use online tutorials and community forums for troubleshooting.
2. Time constraints: Challenge: With only less than 2 weeks to develop the prototype, time management is crucial. Balancing quality with speed will be a significant challenge. Solution: a. Focus on the most critical gameplay elements first, such as core mechanics, basic environment setup, and essential animations. Polish and additional features can be added later if time permits. b. Set specific daily goals for each team member, ensuring that key components are completed on time. Regular check-ins will help keep everyone on track.
3. Balancing workload among team members: Challenge: Ensuring that all team members have a fair and balanced workload, especially when it comes to Unity development, could be difficult, given varying skill levels. Solution: a. At the start of the project, assess each member’s strengths and weaknesses within Unity. Assign tasks that match their skills. b. For more complex tasks like programming, consider pairing team members together, so they can share the workload.

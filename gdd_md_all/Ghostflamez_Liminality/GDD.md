# **Game Overview**

The core concept of our game is the "instinctual fear of darkness and the unknown." The main idea is to recreate the experience of "being home alone as a child," as a way to reminisce about the lost days of childhood. In the game, the player will take on the role of a young boy named Mike, who has lost part of his memory due to a car accident. Because of brain damage caused by the accident, Mike is trapped in a state where he cannot perceive the presence of his parents. The player will experience transitions between dreams and reality, gradually piecing together hidden truths or facts, helping Mike to emerge from the fog of his mind.

Our game combines elements of psychological thriller, walking simulator, narrative-driven, and puzzle games. Similar games to our current design include "Lights Off!" However, the prototype of "Lights Off!" only features a vague narrative structure and an ambiguous ending, without enhanced interactive design to increase playability. Building on this prototype, we have integrated narrative structure and puzzle elements into the scenes, creating a clear linear narrative structure, progressively challenging puzzles, and enhanced psychological thriller elements compared to the original prototype.

The target audience for our game is players who are interested in psychological thriller, narrative-driven, walking simulator, and puzzle elements. The puzzles are designed to be progressively challenging, avoiding overly difficult puzzles, and instead focusing more on narrative and immersion. Therefore, as a game with a 10-minute playtime, our game primarily targets players who enjoy psychological thriller and puzzle elements, particularly those interested in narrative-driven content. Due to the game's suspenseful atmosphere and progressively challenging puzzle design, it may be more suitable for players with some gaming experience, and who enjoy exploring and uncovering the truth of the story. We also consider adults who reminisce about their childhood, are interested in exploring the innate human fear, and enjoy narrative-driven games.

The uniqueness of our game lies in its setting, which is based on real experiences that most people have had during their childhood, making it easier to resonate with players and deepen the sense of immersion. Through the combination of narrative and puzzles, players will gradually uncover Mike's lost memories and hidden truths. By introducing transitions between dreams and reality, we blur the boundaries between "reality" and "illusion," further diminishing the player's perception of time and space, enhancing the psychological thriller atmosphere of the game. Finally, we have introduced an open-ended conclusion to the linear narrative. The eerie family photo that appears at the end hints that the true ending may not be what it seems, creating a sense of layers within layers and an inescapable feeling. This design further deepens the emotional impact of the game and adds unique depth and experience to it.

# **Story and Narrative**

One day, Mike wakes up alone to find that he is the only one in the house. A note left on the table tells him that his parents will be home late tonight. They’ve left food for him in the fridge and reminded him to turn off all the lights in the house before going to bed. On the first night, Mike heats up the food in the microwave and eats dinner alone. After turning off the lights (puzzle 0), Mike enters a dream state—a world similar to his bedroom but distorted, with a grayish-white filter. In the dream, he solves a puzzle (puzzle A) and finds a strangely shaped key.

The next day, his parents still haven’t returned home, but the fridge is restocked with new food and a normal-shaped key. Mike heats up the food in the microwave and eats dinner alone again. Mike used the key found in the refrigerator to unlock the door to his parents' room, which had previously been locked. Upon entering the room, he solved a puzzle (Puzzle B) and discovered a diary with a combination lock.

When it’s time to sleep that night, Mike notices that one of the lights in the house is malfunctioning—the light has changed from white to yellow and flickering. After turning off the lights and before falling completely asleep, he hears the sound of the door opening. His inner monologue assumes it’s his parents returning home and that they will explain why they didn’t come back the previous night. In the dream, Mike solves another puzzle (puzzle C) and finds a family photo.

On the third day, his parents still haven’t returned, but this time, there is no food in the fridge, but a big cake is placed on the table. Mike notices a man’s coat hanging on the coat rack by the entrance and a pair of women’s shoes on the doormat. These signs suggest that his parents have at least been home. Mike finds it odd—where did his parents go? Following the guidance of a vague voice, he finds the family photo on the bookshelf, but strangely, only his face is blurred in the picture; the parts of the photo showing his parents’ faces are clear.

That night, Mike notices that the malfunctioning light has completely gone out. When it’s time to sleep, Mike turns off all the lights and goes to bed hungry. In the dream, he solves another puzzle (puzzle D) and finds the password to the diary. The diary belongs to his father, and the last entry, dated six months ago, describes how Mike was involved in a severe car accident.

On the fourth day, his parents still haven’t returned, but someone has left hot food on the table. At night, Mike discovers that the power has gone out. Before being plunged into complete darkness, Mike solves another puzzle (puzzle E) and finds batteries and a flashlight. Although the power is out, he still follows his mother’s instructions to turn off all the light switches and goes to bed. In the dream, after solving a puzzle (puzzle F), Mike remembers his mother’s phone number. When he dials it on the landline, he hears his mother’s phone ringing from his parents’ room. All signs indicate that his parents are in the house, but why can’t he see them?

On the fifth day, Mike wakes up alone again, but this time there is no note on the table, and the fridge hasn't been restocked with food. The house feels eerily quiet, as if something is being hinted at. Mike walks into his parents' room and hears the same phone ringtone from his dream the night before. He finds his mother's phone in the room, and the screen displays a call from his father.

When Mike pick up the phone, he hears his parents' voices. His mother gently says, "Mike, we've always been by your side, but you just can't see us. You need to face this to escape this nightmare." His father adds in a deep voice, "You must understand that we never left you, but your mind has been wounded. Mike, wake up."

At this point, the game flashes back to scattered memory fragments: the car accident, a hospital bed, the doctor speaking solemnly with his father, and his mother's gentle face. These fragments come together, gradually revealing the truth about the accident. Mike suddenly realizes that he is actually in a coma and that all his previous experiences were not real, just illusions created by his mind.

Mike turns and walks out of his parents' room, entering the living room. He looks at the family photo on the wall again, and this time, his vision clears, and his parents' faces become visible. He finally understands that he has been trapped in this endless dream, and he needs to "wake up" to escape it.

As this realization dawns, all the lights in the room grow brighter and brighter. Mike picks up the family photo and softly says, 'Mom, Dad, I’m sorry. I understand now. I need to wake up.' The lights reach their brightest, and the screen turns completely white.

The game then transitions back to the real world, the camera pulling back to show Mike lying on a hospital bed, with the sound of the monitor gradually becoming clearer, and his parents' faint figures appearing outside the room. The game slowly fades out from this scene, finally ending with the family photo on the bedside table. Strangely, this time, his parents' faces are blurred, but Mike's face is clear.

The game ends.

# **Gameplay and Mechanics**

In this section, we will detail how the game operates, including the player's perspective, controls, game progression, core gameplay mechanics, and how these mechanics enhance the psychological thriller atmosphere and immersion.

---

1. **Player Perspective**
    
    The game uses a first-person perspective with a fixed camera height from the ground. Players can control movement using the WASD keys and adjust the camera angle using the mouse. The player's body is not visible in the view, fully immersing the player in the character's perspective, which helps to enhance the sense of immersion and identification with the character.
    
2. **Controls**
    
    Players move the character using the WASD keys and control the character's viewpoint with the mouse. Additionally, players can interact with objects in the environment using the E and F keys, as well as the left mouse button. These controls are simple and intuitive, allowing players to quickly grasp the game while providing flexibility for exploring the environment and solving puzzles.
    
3. **Progression**
    
    As a role-playing style linear narrative game, the game's progression is divided into several nights over time. Each night, the room layout subtly changes, introducing new puzzles and narrative elements. There is no concept of "dying" or "losing" in the game. Instead, players are gradually guided to solve puzzles and move the game forward. If a player cannot solve a puzzle, they might get "stuck" and be unable to proceed to the next night, but the game will provide hints when necessary to ensure progress. The game does not have a scoring system, and the player's motivation comes from the desire to uncover the full story and the truth.
    
4. **Core Mechanics**
    
    The core actions players can take include exploring the environment, solving puzzles, and interacting with objects. These actions help players progress through the game, while also allowing them to gradually understand the narrative through solving puzzles and exploration. The puzzles are designed based on logic, memory, and exploration. Some puzzles are closely related to the storyline, while others are designed purely for gameplay or serve as tutorials.
    
    Environmental interaction is a key part of the game, requiring players to find hidden objects, trigger events in the scene, or activate cutscenes or dialogues under certain conditions. Core puzzles serve as the condition for completing each night, while additional interactions help players fully understand the narrative.
    
    The game's narrative structure is linear, but specific puzzle solutions may influence the player's understanding of the story or change small details in the game.
    
5. **Psychological thriller Elements**
    
    The game employs various mechanisms to create a psychological thriller atmosphere (focusing on an eerie, unsettling feeling rather than just pure thriller). These mechanisms include:
    
    - **Psychological Suggestion**: Hinting that the player is not alone in the house, suggesting that their parents might not be real, or implying that the information they know might be false.
    - **Contrary to Common Sense**: Such as can't see yourself in the mirror.
    - **Dynamic Scenes**: Such as the disappearance or increase of objects.
    - **Oppressive Psychology**: Repetitive behavior patterns.
    
    Classic thriller elements include:
    
    - **Visual Limitation**: Sudden blackouts, flickering lights, forced use of a flashlight.
    - **Environmental Awareness**: Changes in the color of lights.
    - **Sound**: Heartbeats, insect chirps, footsteps, objects falling, whispering, and varying sound volumes.
    - **Light Manipulation**: Blurred faces in the family photo.
    - **Restricted Movement**: Such as a corridor that gradually narrows as the game progresses..
    - **Item Awareness**: Such as a slightly ajar door.
6. **Time and Space Distortion**
    
    The game features "Two Worlds," including "Dream" and "Reality," distinguished by different filter effects. The switching between these worlds is the basis for some puzzle designs. In the dream world, previously normal room elements are distorted in form, location, or color. These designs aim to blur the boundaries between "reality," "imagination," and "dreams," causing the player to gradually lose their sense of time and space.
    
    The core mechanic throughout the game is "turning off all the lights and going to bed." Most puzzles ultimately serve this goal. The obstacles players encounter include, but are not limited to, broken lights, power outages, etc. These obstacles mostly lead to specific puzzles, and solving these puzzles may result in players obtaining items such as a "flashlight," "keys," or "diaries." These items may be useful in later stages or contain narrative content. By solving puzzles, players are able to "turn off all the lights and go to bed," and then move on to the next night (the next level).
    

## **Game World**

The game world exists in a 3D representation of a house, taking place across multiple different rooms. Each room has two states, the first being in the normal state where everything occurs as it should, with normal furniture and household items. The second state is the dreamlike state and in this state the rooms will change into distorted versions of what they were in the normal state. Things will be disoriented and out of place along with the colours being different. This environment will be captured in a fixed-camera first-person perspective increasing immersion and vulnerability. Due to the small area of the Game navigation of the areas will be simple and straight forward intuitively guiding the player to their next objective. At the start of the game, the player can only access certain rooms; as the game progresses, more areas will be unlocked.

### Normal State vs Dream State

![Kitchen.png](Images/Kitchen.png)

![KitchenDream.png](Images/KitchenDream.png)

### Objects:

Objects are categorized into interactive and non-interactive objects. Most non-interactive objects are used as environmental items to construct the scene and are clearly immovable. Among the interactive objects, some are also movable. Interactive items include two types: the first type is collectible items, such as keys, diaries, and other props. The second type consists of interactive scene objects, such as doors, switches, drawers, beds, family portraits, and so on.

![Interact.png](Images/Interact.png)

In addition, some objects can also be inspected. When entering inspection mode, the camera is locked, and the object will be fixed at a set distance in front of the camera, allowing you to rotate the object by dragging with the mouse.

![Interact.png](Images/Inspect1.png)

![Interact.png](Images/Inspect2.png)

At the same time, certain objects can be collected. We designed a simple inventory system that allows me to view the items in our current inventory in the lower left corner of the UI. When an item is collected, it will be temporarily destroyed in the scene, and its information will be recorded in the inventory.

![Interact.png](Images/Collect.png)

### Physics:

The game will involve minimalist physics such as the player being able to pick up objects and examine them as well as using them to interact with other objects such as doors etc. Doors will act as the barrier to rooms but be able to be opened and closed if unlocked same with hidden drawers. The transition between the normal state and the dream state will occur through the act of going to sleep in the bedroom. This transition will happen with the screen darkening and then as it light comes to again the distortions will be present. At the same time, accompanied by some unsettling sound effects.

![Bed.png](Images/Bed.png)

## **Levels Design**

In the narrative section, we mentioned several puzzles, labeled sequentially as Puzzle 0, Puzzle A through Puzzle F. Some of these puzzles will revolve around 'how to turn off all the lights,' while others will focus on 'finding certain things through clues

### Puzzle 0

This is the first puzzle in the game. This puzzle is designed to introduce players to the mechanics of turning off all the lights. The puzzle's objective is to guide the player to find all the switches. All the switches in this level are in obvious locations, scattered across the walls throughout the scene. In this level, there is one broken switch that, when interacted with, does not turn any corresponding light on or off. Additionally, there are two switches that both control the same light. All switches in this level are located near their corresponding lights.

### Puzzle A

In the dream version of the bedroom, a mirror appears on the wall. Through the mirror, Mike notices that a certain spot on the bookshelf is missing a book. By finding the corresponding book in the room and interacting with it, Mike can take out the book and discover a hidden key inside.

### Puzzle B

Player entered the parents' room. Inside the room, there is a desk with a locked drawer. On the desk, there is a potted plant and a watering can. The player needs to interact with the watering can on the desk to water the potted plant. After interacting, a subtitle appears saying, "It seems like there is something inside the plant." The player finds the key seen in the dream hidden inside the plant. Then, the player can use this key to open the drawer and find a diary with a combination lock.

### Puzzle C

In the dream, Mike finds a broken picture frame on the dining table. Upon examining the frame, a text prompt appears: "It seems like a photo is missing..." As he checks the entire room, he notices that the refrigerator door, the microwave door, and the drawer in his parents' room are all open. By interacting with these three locations, he discovers three fragments of a photo. Once all three fragments are collected, he interacts with the frame again, and a repaired photo appears—a family photo, but with all three faces blurred.

### Puzzle D

In his room, Mike notices a new tear-off calendar hanging on the wall. Interacting with it triggers a narration: "Mom always reminded me to tear off the page to the latest date every day..." Interacting again, the calendar updates from August 30th to August 31st. A new narration follows: "August 31st... cake... is this... my birthday? Today is my birthday?" At this point, the code "0831" can be used to unlock the diary.

### Puzzle E

On the fourth night, Mike discovers that there is a sudden power outage in the house, plunging the entire place into darkness. A narration explains: "Damn, a power outage... I need something to light up the place." Mike needs to find a flashlight and batteries to continue exploring in the dark. The dark scene requires the following settings: adjust the ambient lighting to be near pure black, turn off the scene's light sources, use a vignette effect to enhance the focus on the central area, and place some faint spotlights at windows, doors, and props as guides. Additionally, use a fog effect sparingly.

Accompanied by a steady, rhythmic dripping sound, a narration adds, "The kitchen faucet is leaking again... wait... didn't Dad say the flashlight is in the kitchen?" Upon entering the kitchen, there are two interactable drawers. When interacting with the second drawer (regardless of the order), the player finds the flashlight, and the dripping sound stops. The player attempts to interact with the flashlight to use it, but a prompt appears: "It seems to be missing... batteries?"

A faint buzzing sound guides the player towards the refrigerator. Opening the refrigerator door, under the light from inside, they find a note. Upon interacting with the note, a narration comments: "Why does the fridge still have power during a blackout?" The note reads: "Power's out, Mike? The batteries are in my coat pocket — Dad." The player then heads to the coat rack at the entrance and interacts with the father's coat to find the batteries. Interacting with the flashlight again will turn it on.

### Puzzle F

In the dream, there is a large landline phone placed on the living room table where a four-digit number can be dialed. On the two walls of the living room, the words "Check" and "Note" are written. The player can interact with the inventory to inspect the notes left by the mother on the first day and the two notes from the father found in the refrigerator in Puzzle E. Upon interaction, a voice-over hints, "There seems to be some numbers on the back of the notes..." The back of the two notes reveals the numbers: "03" and "14." Entering "0314" into the landline causes the phone in the parents' room to ring. However, the parents' room is locked and cannot be accessed.

# **Art and Audio**

### Art Style:

The game will be using a pixel art style which will help to create a simple, charming yet nostalgic feeling which will be reminiscent of older 2D games. This will have a limited colour palette which will help convey the feelings of this nostalgic setting capturing the essence of a 2000’s era Australian home. The colours will be slightly muted with some colours popping for emphasis. The pixel art will be simplistic and not overly detailed to add to the ambiguity of the game. During the dreamlike states there will be simple distortions from the regular state. Such as shifting colours, some glitch like effects and distorted shapes.

### Sound and Music:

The game will have a chiptune Soundtrack reminiscent of the retro-style games of the time. The music will be atmospheric, which will build tension and complement the game’s themes. The sound effects used will use 8-bit or 16-bit sounds which will help to make the sounds crisp and and satisfying. Subtle uneasy sounds will be used such as whispers, distorted voices and door creaks to increase the psychological tension. In the dream sequences the sounds will become more abstract to help blur the line between reality and this state.

### Assets:

For the environment tile sets will be used for the walls, floors, and ceilings which will be designed with the first person perspective in mind. The furniture, appliances and interactive objects will be created as individual sprites potentially from multiple angles to help with the 3D immersion. To design the Tile sets Aseprite or Pyxel Edit software will be utilised. For the assets we will try to use as many free pre-made assets from websites such as [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org/) or [itch.io](http://itch.io/) and we will design the rest ourselves.

# **User Interface (UI)**

### main menu screen

For the main menu screen, the background features a family portrait, with "Start," "Exit," and "Settings" buttons positioned near the lower center of the screen. Every 3-5 seconds, the faces of the parents or children in the family portrait will become blurred or clear, accompanied by screen distortion during this process. Additionally, every 3-5 seconds, the entire screen will switch between no filter and a chromatic aberration filter. 

### During the game

The player is allowed to interact with certain objects by picking them up, to view them or to make the object do certain things (eg: Opening a door). When the player hovers over an interactable object, a prompt will show up on screen as “[E] Interact” in a small black box, to indicate to the player. 

Certain events may happen, which could include dialogue to show the player what the child is thinking, or a narrator that indicates these events to the player, e.g: “You found a key” or “This item looks familiar..” These dialogues will be shown as subtitles near the bottom centre of the screen. Additionally, when necessary, some of the child's inner monologue will also be displayed as subtitles near the bottom center of the screen.

To indicate the progress of an interaction, some interactions will be displayed as a gradually expanding progress bar around a small black box showing the corresponding key on the screen while the key is being held down (as shown in the image below).

![image.png](Images/image%205.png)

Another type of interaction that requires a longer duration, such as falling asleep, will be displayed as a bar gradually filling up (as shown in the image below).

![image.png](Images/image%206.png)

FPS would also be shown at Top left corner of the Game.

# **Technology and Tools**

### Game Engine

To help develop the game, our team will use the Unity 2022 Game Engine, which will be powerful and sufficient enough to develop a small game that has a roughly 10-minute playtime. It offers a minimalistic and simple approach to coding, but opens the developer with lots of control in terms of graphics and design.

### Workload Distribution

We will utilise GitHub to create a repository for our project, so the workload can be evenly distributed throughout the team, which opens for collaboration. Members can push their changes to specific aspects of the game over the course of development to finally piece together the final product of the game.

### Asset Development

For a minimalistic game, our first option in finding assets such as 3D objects, audio and images would be through external websites that offer downloadable, preferably free and royalty-free assets. This is to reduce the workload for the game, so the remaining effort can be put into other aspects of the game, such as game logic. However, the style of our game is our first priority, and we will not trade off the look and feel of our game for a reduced workload. In this case we will have to create our own assets using external programs.

Due to the setting of the game, objects will most likely consist of things inside the average household, i.e: Furniture, cupboards, etc. We want to keep the setting to a moderately-low fidelity, excluding objects such as cutlery on a table, papers, etc, in order to decrease the frustration of the player not being able to find the right clues. Assets could be found on Turbosquid and Sketchfab, otherwise an external tool such as Blender will be sufficient enough to create simple, low-poly objects that fit the style of the game.

For game audio, we could use websites such as [https://freesound.org/](https://freesound.org/) or [https://pixabay.com/](https://pixabay.com/), and other possible websites to look for audio assets that fit the style of our game. However, if we want a specific sound, we may have to personally record it via microphone, and edit the audio using an external program like Audacity.

Images may not be required for our game, however if there is a possiblity, we could use an external program such as Photoshop, or a free but sufficient version such as Paint.net

# Team Communication, Timelines and Task Assignment
![w](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6da1cc9a-ddf8-4e59-ac05-7b768b1180ba)
![M](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6634dd49-196b-45f9-8c83-f3eb57ef743f)

To manage and distribute the workload among our group members, we will use the Monday app as a work schedule management tool, and Whatsapp as a main method of communication either on desktop or mobile and via text or voice calls to communicate the state of development.

We will have a dedicated day each week to voice call together and discuss certain aspects of the game that either needs work or needs refining, where Monday can be used to delegate these tasks.

Monday allows the group members see what exactly needs to be done within set weeks, what each group member is assigned to what tasks, their due date and what tasks are yet to come so members can allocate time in their existing schedule to complete them. Allowing set milestones also ensures the project is complete within the time frame.

Once these tasks are completed, the changes will be pushed to the personal branches of the project repository on GitHub. Subsequently, the member responsible for merging branches will consolidate the changes from each branch into the main branch after confirmation in a meeting, facilitating collaboration on each other's work.

### Work Allocation
1. Game Level Design, Character Control, and Interaction Development (Jam)
2. UI/UX Prototype Design, Camera Perspective, and Scene Setup (Oscar)
3. Basic Animation Prototype Design, and Artistic Asset Integration and Optimization (Nuka)
4. GDD Documentation Maintenance, Testing and Quality Assurance, Game Logic and Prototype Validation (Yicong)

### Timeline
1. - Complete level designs and validate interaction logic.
   - Design the game UI based on the GDD, ensuring alignment with the art style and smooth user experience.
   - Maintain the GDD and project documentation, ensuring consistency and compliance with submission requirements.

2. - Integrate external artistic assets (3D models, images, sound effects).
   - Ensure asset compatibility for WebGL deployment and stay within the 250MB asset folder limit.
     
3. - Set up the initial scene and implement camera mechanics.
   - Add basic animations and player controls (movement, item interaction).
   - Test player controls and ensure basic interactive logic works across scenes.
     
4. - Ensure proper interaction between camera, characters, and environment.
   - Arrange game scenes based on the GDD, enhancing visual style and immersion.

# Challenges

A possible challenge may be conflicting logic systems or generalization of classes within the game that may either conflict, be too detailed or too broad in logic to use to create different parts of the game. For example, instead of having two people work on their own implementation of how an item is picked up, one person should create the broader class for how all items will be picked up, and perhaps another could be specific on what how that item reacts or is handled after being picked up, through class inheritance.

- A solution to this would be through a creation of a UML class diagram prior to coding, so the team will have a clearer picture of how the systems within the game will be coded and interact with eachother.
- Another solution is to first work on and refining the broader classes first, before using inheritance to move into more specific logics of the game.

Another could be due to time and schedule constraints of different team members, which may have significant costs on the rigidity and quality of the final game, as some members may be forced to rush a certain aspect of the game which can lead to bugs or poor implementation.

- A solution is a work schedule, which dot points which aspects of the game should be completed within that week for each group member. However, sometimes the aspect may not be fully completed or completed to the quality that is up to standard due to unexpected time constraints, or a feature that takes more time than expected due to factors such as the Engine’s limited capability or the difficulty of implementing that feature. These should be taken into account when making the work schedule, so other members can help those who are falling behind within that week. At the end of each week, a prototype could be created to test all existing aspects of the game to ensure working fluidity  .

(New challenger–p2_milestone_1)
The challenge with the inventory system involves fixing issues like item duplication, incorrect stacking, and glitches in drag-and-drop functionality. These bugs disrupt smooth item management and player interactions, requiring refinement for a seamless experience.

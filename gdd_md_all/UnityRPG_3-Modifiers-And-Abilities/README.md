# Unity RPG Course - Section 3 - Modifiers And Abilities

Welcome to Section 3 of the [Unity RPG](http://gdev.tv/rpggithub) course – the full course is part of a Kickstarter campaign which was over 200% funded. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 360,336 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

Customise character abilities, weapons, characters and enemies. This includes multiple damage types, modifiers, sounds, animations. By the end you can create your core combat experience. 

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! Please note that future sections contain assets with commercial use restrictions. The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Unity RPG](http://gdev.tv/rpggithub)

### 24 Player Choice In Combat
1. What are the choices the player can make in your combat?
2. Types of Special Abilities
3. Where to start with implementation


### 25 RPG Special Abilities System Overview
1. Abilities require serialisable data AND behaviour
2. We can only serialise MonoBehaviours via prefab or scene
3. This causes more contention on those files, and is wrong place
4. A ScriptableObject moves ability config data to a .asset file
5. ... but SOs cannot interact with the world
6. so the Ability also needs a MonoBehaviour
7. One ability can have multiple configs
8. Therefore make the config add the behaviour component at runtime.


### 26 Storing Special Ability Config data
1. Setup an 'ISpecialAbilty' interface
2. Use an abstract class to create `SpecialAbilityConfig`
3. Inherit 'PowerAttackConfig' from this new abstract class
4. Provide right-click asset menu to create new special ability.


### 27 Making A Class Single Purpose
1. Remove `pointsPerHit` from our `Energy` component
2. Move right-click handling to the `Player`
3. Prepare to read energy cost from special ability.


### 28 Implementing Power Attack Behaviour
1. Fix a bug with our AudioTrigger component
2. Make it possible for the player to equip several abilities
3. Use a protected property to reference `behaviour` component
4. Use this property to forward calls to `Use()` to the component.


### 29 Using Structs For Parameter Sets
1. Combine top-level special ability code into one file
2. Create a struct to pass ability use parameters
3. Finish Power Attack behaviour inc energy cost.

### 30 Create An Area Of Effect Ability
1. Describe your challenge
2. Introduce `Physics.ShpereCastAll()` API

# Project__1
*Name it be discussed at end of development. We're just going to call it "Project_1" for now*

## Engine
Unreal Engine 4

## Tools
General rule of thumb is to not use any pirated software tools for development. It sabotages our ability to sell the game when the time comes. 
* Blender for 3D art. Easier for project cohesion
* Image Software like Photoshop, GIMP, Krita
* GitHub for project management, cohesion, tasks and project discussion.
* Discord, we should only use it to shoot the shit with each-other, project related talk should go into GitHub Discussions tab.

## Game
General consensus is to make a game that's easy to create for our first project. Traditionally, 2D games are quick to create and scale, so we are starting with making a game similar to **SUPER MEAT BOY**. It has replay-ability, mechanics are easy to create programmerly and the art style is easy to create without too much detail. It's still not as easy as you think to make, but it's doable with the skills we have on hand. This is a great first project to learn how to use the tools, communicate and use team work. 

If we can finish this game, on time, and while having fun, that's great! This is our opportunity to get the ball rolling. 

## Time-frame
**We didn't start the project yet, but only just established the GitHub project, don't do anything in that UE4 project until otherwise instructed**

Time | Task
------------ | -------------
First 30 Days | R&D, level blocking, testing
Second 30 Days | Full development for art, programming, anim, audio etc
Third 30 Days | Testing, bug fixes and polish

# What you need to learn
**Head to the Discussions tab for useful links**
* GitHub installation with Git and GitLFS along side the desktop app and how to use with Unreal Engine 4
* Proper Naming Conventions
* Pushing & Pull requests
* How to read the Game Design Document.md in the Code tab to ensure we are have project cohesion
* Utilizing the project tab, milestones and issue tracker correctly. 

# Project Leaders
We all have our own skill-sets and are all capable of multiple roles. However, we need to semi-specialize and have some organization or else it will be chaos. For this specific first project, I have put together a position roles that are filled or can be filled. Keep in mind, this is the FIRST project, so there will be role changes as we all learn how we work together for the next project. This is our learning project. 

Producer = ChrisL

Technical Manager = JonR

Programmer Lead = ChrisL

Artist Lead = *To be determined democratically*

Animator Lead = *To be determined democratically*

Design Lead = None, we are basically copying a game for the first test project together. We already know the basic design principals from **SUPER MEAT BOY**

Audio Lead = *To be determined democratically*

Writer Lead = *To be determined democratically*

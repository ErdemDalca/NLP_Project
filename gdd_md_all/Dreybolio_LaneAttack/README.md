In Lane Attack, the player must destroy the enemy's base at the right end  to win. If the player’s character dies, or the enemy destroys the player’s base, the player loses. Defeating enemies gives the player money, which they can use to spawn units to further attack the enemy with.
There are three lanes that the battle will take place in. The player can switch lanes freely but most units and enemies will stay in the same lane they started in. This means the player must multitask managing all of the lanes to ensure they do not get overwhelmed in any of them.
